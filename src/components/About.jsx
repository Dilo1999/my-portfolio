        <p className="about-intro">
          I'm <strong>Dilshan Senanayaka</strong>, a final-year undergraduate pursuing a
          Bachelor of Information and Communication Technology (BICT) Honours degree at the
          University of Sri Jayewardenepura, specializing in Software Technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm an enthusiastic, self-motivated, and reliable developer with a passion for crafting
          user-friendly software solutions. My strengths lie in full-stack web and mobile
          application development using technologies like <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Laravel</strong>,
          <strong> Firebase</strong>, and <strong>Android Studio</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have hands-on experience through internships and projects where I built and enhanced
          platforms for real-world users—ranging from CRM systems to IoT-based greenhouse automation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond technical expertise, I take pride in my creativity, team spirit, leadership, and
          adaptability—traits that help me thrive in collaborative and high-pressure environments.
